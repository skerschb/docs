MongoDB is released as two editions: *Community* and *Enterprise*.
Community is the open source release of MongoDB. Enterprise provides 
additional administration, authentication, and monitoring features. 
*Installation steps vary depending on the edition; both procedures are 
outlined in this section.*

For upgrade instructions, see :ref:`4.0-upgrade` instead.

.. note::

   .. versionadded:: 3.6

      Each MongoDB installer is packaged with a platform-specific
      :ref:`MongoDB Compass <compass-index>` installation script. This
      script installs MongoDB Compass as part of the MongoDB Server
      installation process.
