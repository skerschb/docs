.. dbcommand:: killSessions

   .. versionadded:: 3.6

   The :dbcommand:`killSessions` command kills the specified sessions.
   If access control is enabled, the command only kills the sessions
   owned by the user.

   .. include:: /includes/note-killSessions.rst

   :dbcommand:`killSessions` has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { killSessions: [ { id : <UUID> }, ... ] } )

   The command takes an array of documents that specify the UUID
   portion of the session id. If you specify an empty array, the
   command kills all sessions, or if access control is enabled, all
   sessions owned by the user.

   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand.rst

   .. |command| replace:: :dbcommand:`killSessions`

   To view existing sessions, see :pipeline:`$listSessions` operation
   or :pipeline:`$listLocalSessions`.

Behavior
--------

Session Identification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB concatenates each of the specified UUIDs with the hash of the
authenticated user credentials to identify the user's sessions to kill.
If the user has no session that match, the :dbcommand:`killSessions`
has no effect.


Example
-------

The following operation kills the specified session for the user:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { killSessions: [ { id: UUID("f9b3d8d9-9496-4fff-868f-04a6196fc58a") } ] } )
