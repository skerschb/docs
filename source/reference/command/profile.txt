.. dbcommand:: profile

   .. versionchanged:: 4.0

      The command can be run on :binary:`~bin.mongos` with ``profile``
      level:

      - ``0`` to set the ``slowms`` and ``sampleRate`` for the system
        log; i.e. you cannot enable the profiler on a
        :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

      - ``-1`` to read the current settings.

   For a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, the command enables, disables,
   or configures the :doc:`/tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler`. The
   profiler captures and records data on the performance of write
   operations, cursors, and database commands on a running
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. If the profiler is disabled, the
   command sets the ``slowms`` and ``sampleRate`` for logging slow
   operations to the diagnostic log.
   
   For :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance, the command sets the ``slowms``
   and ``sampleRate`` configuration settings, which configure how
   operations get written to the diagnostic log.

   The profiler is off by default.

   The :dbcommand:`profile` command has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        profile: <level>,
        slowms: <threshold>,
        sampleRate: <rate>
      }

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/dbcommand-profile-fields.rst

The :method:`db.getProfilingStatus()` and
:method:`db.setProfilingLevel()` :doc:`shell methods
</reference/method>` provide wrappers around the :dbcommand:`profile`
command.

.. |binary| replace:: :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`

Behavior
--------

The :dbcommand:`profile` command obtains a write lock on the affected
database while enabling or disabling the profiler. This is typically a
short operation. The lock blocks other operations until the
:dbcommand:`profile` command has completed.

   :ref:`Database Profiling <database-profiling>`.
