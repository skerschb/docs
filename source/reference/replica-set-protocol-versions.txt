============================
Replica Set Protocol Version
============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb


Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB only supports replica set protocol
version 1 (:rsconf:`pv1 <protocolVersion>`). ``pv1`` is the default for
all new replica sets created with MongoDB 3.2 or later.

Preservation of Writes
----------------------

``w:1`` Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With :rsconf:`pv1 <protocolVersion>`, you can use
:rsconf:`~settings.catchUpTimeoutMillis` to prioritize between faster
failovers and preservation of :writeconcern:`w:1 <\<number\>>` writes.

``w: "majority"`` Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``pv1`` guarantees the preservation of confirmed :writeconcern:`w:
"majority" <"majority">` writes.

Availability
------------

``pv1`` is available in MongoDB version 3.2 or later and is the default
for all new replica sets created with version 3.2 or later.

Arbiters
--------

Priorities
----------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/priorities-and-pvs.rst

Vetoes
------

``pv1`` does not use vetoes. Individual members can vote for or against
a candidate in a particular election, but cannot individually veto (abort)
an election unilaterally.

.. _simultaneous-primaries:

Detection of Simultaneous Primaries
-----------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/footnote-two-primaries-edge-cases.rst

``pv1`` uses the concept of :term:`term`. This allows for a faster
detection of simultaneous primaries and for multiple successful
elections in a short period of time.

Back to Back Elections
----------------------

``pv1`` makes a "best-effort" attempt to have the secondary with the
highest :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` available call an election. This
could lead to back-to-back elections as eligible members with
higher priority can call an election.

However, in MongoDB 3.6+ (as well as MongoDB 3.4.2+ and 3.2.12+), for ``pv1``:

- Priority elections have been limited to occur only if the higher
  priority node is within 10 seconds of the current primary. 

- Arbiters will vote no in elections if they detect a healthy primary
  of equal or greater priority to the candidate.

Starting in MongoDB 3.4, you can also reduce the likelihood of rollback of
:writeconcern:`w:1 <\<number\>>` writes with ``pv1`` by raisings the
:rsconf:`~settings.catchUpTimeoutMillis` setting.

Double Voting
-------------

``pv1`` prevents double voting in one member's call for election. This
is achieved through its use of :term:`terms <term>`.

.. _update-replica-set-protocol-version:

Modify Replica Set Protocol Version
------------------------------------

To change the replica set protocol version, reconfigure
(:method:`rs.reconfig`) the replica set with the new
:rsconf:`protocolVersion`. To upgrade to ``pv1``, connect
a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the current primary and perform the
following sequence of operations:

.. code-block:: sh

   cfg = rs.conf();
   cfg.protocolVersion=1;
   rs.reconfig(cfg);

You can use :rsconf:`~settings.catchUpTimeoutMillis` to prioritize
between faster failovers and preservation of :writeconcern:`w:1
<\<number\>>` writes.
