Read Concern ``"majority"``

For read operations not associated with :doc:`multi-document
transactions </core/transactions>`, read concern ``"majority"``
guarantees that the data read has been acknowledged by a majority of
the replica set members (i.e. the documents read are durable and
guaranteed not to roll back).

However, for operations in :doc:`multi-document transactions
</core/transactions>`, read concern ``"majority"`` provides its
guarantees only if the transaction commits with :ref:`write concern
"majority" <transactions-write-concern>`. Otherwise, the
:readconcern:`"majority"` read concern provides no guarantees about the
data read in transactions.

Example
-------

.. include:: /includes/fact-read-concern-write-timeline.rst

Then, the following tables summarizes the state of the data that a read
operation with :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern would see at
time ``T``.

   * - Read Target

   * - Primary

   * - Secondary\ :sub:`2`
     - Before or at t\ :sub:`6`
     - Data reflects Write\ :sub:`prev`

Storage Engine Support
----------------------

Read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` is available for the
WiredTiger storage engine.

.. tip::

   The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns the
   :serverstatus:`storageEngine.supportsCommittedReads` field which
   indicates whether the storage engine supports ``"majority"`` read
   concern.

Causally Consistent Sessions
----------------------------

Read concern :readconcern:`majority` is available for use with causally
consistent sessions.

Read Concern ``"majority"`` and Transactions
--------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-read-concern-tip.rst

.. note:: 

   You set the read concern at the transaction level, not at the
   individual operation level. To set the read concern for
   transactions, see :ref:`transaction-options`.

For operations in :doc:`multi-document transactions
</core/transactions>`, read concern ``"majority"`` provides its
guarantees only if the transaction commits with :ref:`write concern
"majority" <transactions-write-concern>`. Otherwise, the
:readconcern:`"majority"` read concern provides no guarantees about the
data read in transactions.
