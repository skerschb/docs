description: |
  A valid :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` that ``$reduce`` applies
  to each element in the ``input`` array in left-to-right order. Wrap the ``input``
  value with :expression:`$reverseArray` to yield the equivalent of applying
  the combining expression from right-to-left.
  
  During evaluation of the ``in`` expression, two variables will be available:
  
  - ``value`` is the :doc:`variable </reference/aggregation-variables>`
    that represents the cumulative value of the expression.
    
  - ``this`` is the :doc:`variable</reference/aggregation-variables>`
    that refers to the element being processed.
