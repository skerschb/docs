arg_name: field

  The field or fields to group. Returns a "key object" for use as the
  grouping key.
interface: command
name: key
operation: group
optional: false
position: 2
type: document
---
arg_name: field
description: |
  An aggregation function that operates on the documents during the
  grouping operation. These functions may return a sum or a count. The
  function takes two arguments: the current document and an aggregation
  result document for that group.
interface: command
name: $reduce
operation: group
optional: false
position: 3
type: function

arg_name: field

  Initializes the aggregation result document.
interface: command
name: initial
operation: group
optional: false
position: 4

arg_name: field
description: |
  Alternative to the ``key`` field. Specifies a function that creates a
  "key object" for use as the grouping key. Use ``$keyf`` instead of
  ``key`` to group by calculated fields rather than existing document
  fields.
interface: command
name: $keyf
operation: group
optional: true
position: 5
type: function
---
arg_name: field
description: |
  The selection criteria to determine which documents in the
  collection to process. If you omit the ``cond`` field, |obj-name|
  processes all the documents in the collection for the group
  operation.
interface: command
name: cond
operation: group
optional: true
position: 6
type: document
---
arg_name: field
description: |
  A function that runs each item in the result set before |obj-name|
  returns the final value. This function can either modify the result
  document or replace the result document as a whole.
  Unlike the ``$keyf`` and ``$reduce`` fields that also specify a
  function, this field name is ``finalize``, *not* ``$finalize``.
interface: command
name: finalize
operation: group
optional: true
position: 7
type: function
