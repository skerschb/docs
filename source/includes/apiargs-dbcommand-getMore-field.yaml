  Specifies a time limit in milliseconds for processing
  operations on a cursor. If you do not specify a value for {{argname}},
  operations will not time out. A value of ``0`` explicitly
  specifies the default unbounded behavior.
  
  MongoDB terminates operations that exceed their allotted time limit
  using the same mechanism as :method:`db.killOp()`. MongoDB only
  terminates an operation at one of its designated :term:`interrupt 
  points <interrupt point>`.
