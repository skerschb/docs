  Configures the profiler level.
  The following profiler levels are available:
  
  .. include:: /includes/database-profiler-levels.rst


  Since profiling is not available on :binary:`~bin.mongos`,
  :method:`db.setProfilingLevel()` cannot be used to set the profiling
  level to a value other than ``0`` on a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

  Accepts an integer or an options document. If an integer value is
  passed as the ``options`` argument instead of a document, the value is
  assigned to ``slowms``.
  The following options are available:

  .. list-table::
     :stub-columns: 1
     :widths: 15 85

     * - slowms
       - | Default: 100
         | Type: integer

         .. include:: /includes/dbcommand-slowms-definition.rst

         For :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, the setting affects both the
         diagnostic log and, if enabled, the profiler.

         For :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, the setting affects the
         diagnostic log only and not the profiler since profiling is not
         available on :binary:`~bin.mongos`.
         
         .. note::
            This argument affects the same setting as the configuration
            file option :setting:`~operationProfiling.slowOpThresholdMs`.

     * - sampleRate
       - | Default: 1.0
         | Type: double
         
         The fraction of *slow* operations that should be profiled or logged.
         ``sampleRate`` accepts values between 0 and 1, inclusive.

         For :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, the setting affects both the
         diagnostic log and, if enabled, the profiler.

         For :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, the setting affects the
         diagnostic log only and not the profiler since profiling is not
         available on :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

         .. note::
            This argument affects the same setting as the configuration option
            :setting:`~operationProfiling.slowOpSampleRate`.
