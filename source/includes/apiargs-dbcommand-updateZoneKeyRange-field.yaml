  The name of the zone to associate with the range bounded by the 
  ``min`` and ``max``.
  
  If the value does not match an existing zone, the command fails.
  
  Specify ``null`` to remove the association between the range with lower
  bounds of ``min`` and upper bound of ``max`` and the ``updateZoneKeyRange``
  collection. The values of ``min`` and ``max`` must match exactly the target
  range.
