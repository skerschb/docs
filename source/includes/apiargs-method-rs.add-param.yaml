  or a configuration document:

    as found in the :rsconf:`members` array. You must specify the
    :rsconf:`~members[n].host` field in the member configuration
    document.

    .. code-block:: javascript
  
       {
         _id: <int>,
         host: <string>,        // required
         arbiterOnly: <boolean>,
         buildIndexes: <boolean>,
         hidden: <boolean>,
         priority: <number>,
         tags: <document>,
         slaveDelay: <int>,
         votes: <number>
      }

    For a description of the configuration field, refer to
    :rsconf:`members`.

  - If a string, specify the hostname and optionally the port number
    for the new member.
