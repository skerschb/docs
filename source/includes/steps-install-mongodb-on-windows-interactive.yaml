   The wizard steps you through the installation of MongoDB and MongoDB
   Compass.

   You can choose either the :guilabel:`Complete` or :guilabel:`Custom`
   setup type. If you choose the :guilabel:`Custom` installation
   option, you may specify an installation directory. MongoDB has no
   other system dependencies. You can install and run MongoDB from any
   directory.

   Starting in MongoDB 4.0, you can, by default, configure and start
   MongoDB as a service during the install, and the MongoDB service is
   started upon successful installation.

   - If you choose not to configure MongoDB as a service, uncheck the
     :guilabel:`Install MongoD as a Service`.
   
   - If you choose to configure MongoDB as a service, you can:

     - Specify to run the service as one of the following users:

       - Network Service user; i.e. a Windows user account that is
         built-in to Windows
   
       - Local or domain user:

         - For an existing local user account, specify a period (i.e.
           ``.``) for the :guilabel:`Account Domain` and the
           :guilabel:`Account Name` and the :guilabel:`Account
           Password` for the user.
 
         - For an existing domain user, specify the :guilabel:`Account
           Domain`, the :guilabel:`Account Name` and the
           :guilabel:`Account Password` for that user.

     - Specify the Service Name. If you already have a service with the
       specified name, you must choose another name.

     - Specify the Data directory, which corresponds to the
       :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`. If the directory does not
       exist, the installer will create the directory and sets the
       directory access to the service user.

     - Specify the Log directory, which corresponds to the
       :option:`--logpath <mongod --logpath>`. If the directory does not
       exist, the installer will create the directory and sets the
       directory access to the service user.
