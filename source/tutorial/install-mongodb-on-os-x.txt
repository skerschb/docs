Overview
--------

.. _`MongoDB Download Center`: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community?jmp=docs


The following tutorial uses 
`Homebrew <https://brew.sh/?jmp=mongodb-docs>`_ to install MongoDB 
{+version+} Community Edition on macOS systems. To install a different 
version of MongoDB, please refer to that version's documentation.  For example:

- :v4.0:`https://docs.mongodb.com/v4.0 </tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x>`
- :v3.6:`https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.6 </tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x>`
- :v3.4:`https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.4 </tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x>`

Platform Support
----------------

MongoDB 4.2+ only supports macOS versions 10.12+ on
Intel x86-64. See :ref:`mongodb-supported-platforms` for more
information.

Install MongoDB Community Edition
---------------------------------

.. _osx-prereq:

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have the Homebrew ``brew`` package installed on your OSX host 
*and* you have previously tapped the official 
`MongoDB Homebrew Tap <https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew>`_, 
skip the prerequisites and go to the :ref:`install` step.

Install XCode
`````````````
.. container::

   Apple's XCode includes command-line tools that are required
   by ``brew``, and is available for free on the App Store. Make sure
   you are running the latest version.

Install Homebrew
````````````````

.. container::

   OSX does not include the Homebrew ``brew`` package by default.
   Install ``brew`` using the 
   `official instructions <https://brew.sh/#install>`_.

Tap the MongoDB Homebrew Tap
````````````````````````````

.. container::

   Issue the following from the terminal to
   tap the official 
   `MongoDB Homebrew Tap <https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew>`_:

   .. code-block:: sh

      brew tap mongodb/brew 

.. _install:

Install MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   From a terminal, issue the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      brew install mongodb-community@{+version+}

   .. tip::
   
      If you have previously installed an older version of the formula,
      you may encounter a ChecksumMismatchError. To resolve, see
      :ref:`troubleshooting-checksumerror`.

   In addition to the :doc:`binaries </reference/program>`, the install
   creates:

   - the :doc:`configuration file </reference/configuration-options>`
     (:file:`/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf`)

   - the :setting:`log directory path <systemLog.path>` (``/usr/local/var/log/mongodb``)

   - the :setting:`data directory path <storage.dbPath>` (``/usr/local/var/mongodb``)

Run MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   You can run MongoDB as a macOS service using ``brew``, or you can run
   MongoDB manually as a background process. It is recommended to run
   MongoDB as a macOS service, as doing so sets the correct system
   ``ulimit`` values automatically (see
   :ref:`ulimit settings <ulimit-settings>` for more information).

   - To run MongoDB (i.e. the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process) **as a
     macOS service**, issue the following:

     .. code-block:: sh

        brew services start mongodb-community

   - To run MongoDB **manually as a background process**, issue the
     following:

     .. code-block:: sh

        mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf --fork

   Both methods use the :file:`/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf` file created
   during the install. You can add your own MongoDB
   :doc:`configuration options </reference/configuration-options>` to
   this file as well.

   To verify that MongoDB is running, search for ``mongod`` in your
   running processes:

   .. code-block:: sh

      ps aux | grep -v grep | grep mongod

   You can also view the log file to see the current status of your
   ``mongod`` process: ``/usr/local/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log``.

Connect and Use MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   To begin using MongoDB, connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the
   running instance. From a new terminal, issue the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo

   For information on CRUD (Create,Read,Update,Delete) operations, see:

   - :doc:`/tutorial/insert-documents`
   - :doc:`/tutorial/query-documents`
   - :doc:`/tutorial/update-documents`
   - :doc:`/tutorial/remove-documents`

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

.. _troubleshooting-checksumerror:

Troubleshooting ChecksumMismatchError
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have previously installed an older version of the formula,
you may encounter a ChecksumMismatchError, as in the following
example:

.. code-block:: sh

   Error: An exception occurred within a child process:

     ChecksumMismatchError: SHA256 mismatch

   Expected: c7214ee7bda3cf9566e8776a8978706d9827c1b09017e17b66a5a4e0c0731e1f

     Actual: 6aa2e0c348e8abeec7931dced1f85d4bb161ef209c6af317fe530ea11bbac8f0

    Archive: /Users/kay/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads/a6696157a9852f392ec6323b4bb697b86312f0c345d390111bd51bb1cbd7e219--mongodb-macos-x86_64-4.2.0.tgz

   To retry an incomplete download, remove the file above.

To fix:

#. Remove the downloaded :file:`.tgz` archive.

#. Retap the formula.

   .. code-block:: sh

      brew untap mongodb/brew && brew tap mongodb/brew

#. Retry the install.

   .. code-block:: sh

      brew install mongodb-community@{+version+}

Localhost Binding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB binaries, :binary:`mongod
<bin.mongod>` and :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>`, bind to
``localhost`` by default.

When bound only to the localhost, these binaries can only accept
connections from clients that are running on the same machine. Remote
clients cannot connect to the binaries bound only to localhost. For
more information, including how to override and bind to other ip
addresses, see :ref:`3.6-bind_ip-compatibility`.
