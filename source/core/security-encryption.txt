Transport Encryption
--------------------

You can use TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) to
encrypt all of MongoDB's network traffic. TLS/SSL ensures that MongoDB
network traffic is only readable by the intended client.

See :doc:`/core/security-transport-encryption` for more information.

Encryption at Rest
------------------

There are two broad classes of approaches to encrypting data at rest with
MongoDB: Application Level Encryption and Storage Encryption. You can use
these solutions together or independently.

.. versionadded:: 3.2

   MongoDB Enterprise 3.2 introduces a native encryption option for the
   WiredTiger storage engine. This feature allows MongoDB to encrypt data
   files such that only parties with the decryption key can decode and
   read the data.

See :doc:`/core/security-encryption-at-rest` for more information.
